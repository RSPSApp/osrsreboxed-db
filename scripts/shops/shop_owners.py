Description:
Script to resolve the NPC that runs each OSRS Wiki shop.

Shop pages name their shopkeeper in the ``{{Infobox Shop}}`` ``owner`` field,
as a link to the NPC's own wiki page. Matching that name against the NPC
database is not enough on its own — "Shop keeper" is 12 different NPC IDs — so
this module fetches each owner's wiki page and reads the NPC IDs straight out
of its infobox, which is disambiguated per location.

Produces ``data/shops/shop-owners.json``, which ``shops_items.process`` merges
into the exported shop data.
